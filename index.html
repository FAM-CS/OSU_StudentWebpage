        <ol>
            <li> What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?
                 If you've never done anything related to web development, that's fine, but make sure to say that here.
                <p>
                    I've never really done anything related to web development. The closest experience and actually
                    my first brush with programming languages was when my dad was teaching/showing me how he built
                    his Quran website. He introduced the idea of CSS and a flexbox and challenged me to display two
                    images of a book side by side, which I was able to do without his help. Unfortunately, I didn't
                    retain much knowledge from that time.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What do you hope to learn from this class?
                <p>
                    I hope to learn new languages for web development and how I can use those languages to design and
                    implement aesthetically-pleasing and usable websites.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> Have you signed up for our course Campuswire forum?
                <p>
                    Yes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.
                <p>
                    I have done 12 years of online public school (K-11).
