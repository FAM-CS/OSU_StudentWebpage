		<h2>Assignment 1: 4/11/2022</h2>

		<ul>
			<li> What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
				<p>
					I did not really experience any particular trouble completing this assignment. I generally had more
					questions around how to do something like adding a tab or how to add an image to the same line
					(e.g. email icon). I worked through them by experimenting with code and searching on the internet
					and my lecture notes. For example, while experimenting with color VS Code had a prompt for rgb()
					which I then used to get the exact color I wanted.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
				<p>
					Pretty much everything from this assignment was new to me so I learned how to use HTML, structure
					an html file, how to use some CSS styles, and picked up some practices like DOCTYPE and css file
					separation. I found it fun to experiment and search how to make something look the way I want.
					I also challenged myself to make the header of my homepage resemble my resume which I think turned
					out well except for the exact layout.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
				completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<p>
					The most helpful resources for me was the lectures as I learned the basics from them, mainly using
					them by referencing the notes I took. I also downloaded the Live Server extension reccomended by a
					student in the Campuswire forum which was nice for auto-updating the page to reflect saved changes
					to files. I also got some tips from a classmate that has prior HTML/CSS experience who reccomended
					the inspector tool.

		<h2>Assignment 2: 4/25/2022</h2>

		<ul>
			<li> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did
				you solve those problems?
				<p>
					I found the margin and positioning to be challenging for this assignment as things were getting
					shifted
					or had weird spacing. I was able to solve this by use the inspector dev tool on my browser to
					investigate
					the margin and padding of objects which helped me understand how different properties worked
					together. <br />
					Another problem I had was wanting to scale the add-twit button from the center without having to
					calculate the new position myself. After some searching I was able to find the scale() property
					which worked perfectly for my needs.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that
				you already knew?
				<p>
					I learned the basics of positioning, flexboxes, and font-styling. I did not know much going into
					this
					assignment but after I found a lot of cool CSS animations so I may try them later for the
					blog/homepage.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
				completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<p>
					The most helpful resources for me was the lectures as I learned some of the tricks I ended up using
					for this assignment such as the inline display for the list items in the navigation bar. I also
					really liked the frog flexbox which was nice for practice. A student also hinted about using border
					styling to get the underline effect for the active navigation page which led me to find
					border-bottom.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
				<p>
					One thing I had to Google was how to make my button grow from the center as I felt there had to be
					a better/quicker way to do it than having to calculate a new center position. This led me to find
					"transform: scale()" which worked well. Another thing I searched for was removing the margin from my
					nagivation and site title bar, I ended up realizing it was because of some default margins on the
					body element using the stackoverflow link and the inspector tool.

		<h2>Assignment 3: 5/9/2022</h2>

		<ul>
			<li> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did
				you solve those problems?
				<p>
					I found differentiating between collections and actual objects somewhat challenging as I kept
					running
					into errors trying to append to elements by ClassName instead of ID. However, after reading the
					console
					errors from the browser dev tools and using console.log() it made more sense. Other times I was
					not sure what was contained in my text variable for search_twits() as it kept evaluating to false.
					I realized the issue after printing the text of the twit_array and it was in uppercase which made
					indexOf()
					not work initially.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that
				you already knew?
				<p>
					I learned the basics of javascript, how to create event listeners, how to manipulate the DOM, and
					add new content to the DOM. Some insights I had into this was that I first learned some Python in
					CS160-161
					so I was familiar with how a lot of the string and array operations worked. Fortunately, a lot
					of javascript syntax is similar to Python and C++ so it was not hard to pickup/use and the lectures
					were
					awesome for learning.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
				completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<p>
					The most helpful resources for me was the lectures, particularly the ones from 4/27, 5/2, and 5/4.
					I also searched for specific problems / things I wanted to do with JS whenever I had no clue what
					to do. I also reached out to my teammates (for the final project) and they had a lot of good tips
					for the assignment like having to index [0] after getting elements by class name. I also took some
					of the example/demo code from class such as the string cleaning from the wordBoxes.js.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
				<p>
					Two things I had to Google was how to do the search and how to clear an input field.
					I learned I could use the string method indexOf() for searching since it gives the starting index
					for a substring that is in the current string. For clearing the input field, my issue was that
					I was getting the value from the element and then trying to set it to an empty string "" but I was
					not actually changing the value text element.
					<br />
					<br />
					// Does not work <br />
					text = element.value <br />
					text = "" <br />
					// Does work <br />
					element.value = "" <br />
					// This works too <br />
					text = element <br />
					text.value = ""

		<h2>Assignment 4: 5/16/2022</h2>

		<ul>
			<li> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did
				you solve those problems?
				<p>
					For this assignment, I tried to use readFile() but ran into problems with variables being undefined
					due to the asynchronous aspect.
					I went around the problem by using readFileSync() instead. Another issue I ran into was a set_header
					error which I solved by looking up the error and learned that my if statement block structure was
					causing multiple responses to be made.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that
				you already knew?
				<p>
					I learned from this assignment how a server and client interact and how I can facilitate that
					interaction with node.js
					and node modules. I also learned how to serve pages based off request information like the url.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
				completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<p>
					The most helpful resources for me was the lectures and just experimenting with example code
					from the lectures. For the assignment I would just try going to different pages and see what
					each request looked liked which helped me understand the interaction.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
				<p>
					One thing I had to google was how to read files in since I got confused by the asynchronous read
					file.

		<h2>Assignment 5: 5/31/2022</h2>

		<ul>
			<li> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did
				you solve those problems?
				<p>
					I did not find anything particularly challenging about this assignments as I felt fairly comfortable
					with the given program requirements and lecture content. Some problems I ran into was trying to
					render the twitData using the for each loop in handlebars as nothing would appear. After going
					through campuswire hw5 discussion, I found a nice explanation from one of the TAs (Emmanuel) and
					learned that the {{each}} was expecting an object with a mapped array instead of an array to
					iterate over.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another problem I ran into was figuring out how to include the partial I had for the create twit
					button and modal. After some googling I found that I needed a ">" to fit with the syntax.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that
				you already knew?
				<p>
					I learned from this assignment how to templatize html pages, how to create partials for the client
					side, and serve them with Express and Handlebars. I also learned how to leverage package.json to
					create pre-build scripts to compile handlebar files and use nodemon to avoid manually refreshing
					my server each time I save. I also got more comfortable using express and middleware functions. I
					feel like I have a better grasp on how they work / flow.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
				completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<p>
					The most helpful resources for me was the lectures, campuswire forum, and examining the
					example/worked out lecture code. I used lectures by watching along and implementing certain parts
					as I went through the assignment while also referencing my notes. The forum was helpful when I came
					across an issue I would look through the corresponding forum and see if another student faced a
					similar problem to mine and how they were able to resolve it.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
				<p>
					One thing I had to google was how to add/render a partial handlebars file in another handlebar,
					since I could not figure out how to add the createTwit.handlebars partial to
					twitsPage.handlebars.<br />
					I learned that I just needed ">" to fit the partial call syntax.
