        <h2>Assignment 1: 4/11/2022</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?
                <p>
                    I did not really experience any particular trouble completing this assignment. I generally had more
                    questions around how to do something like adding a tab or how to add an image to the same line 
                    (e.g. email icon). I worked through them by experimenting with code and searching on the internet 
                    and my lecture notes. For example, while experimenting with color VS Code had a prompt for rgb()
                    which I then used to get the exact color I wanted.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
                <p>
                    Pretty much everything from this assignment was new to me so I learned how to use HTML, structure
                    an html file, how to use some CSS styles, and picked up some practices like DOCTYPE and css file 
                    separation. I found it fun to experiment and search how to make something look the way I want. 
                    I also challenged myself to make the header of my homepage resemble my resume which I think turned
                    out well except for the exact layout.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
                 completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
                <p>
                    The most helpful resources for me was the lectures as I learned the basics from them, mainly using
                    them by referencing the notes I took. I also downloaded the Live Server extension reccomended by a
                    student in the Campuswire forum which was nice for auto-updating the page to reflect saved changes 
                    to files. I also got some tips from a classmate that has prior HTML/CSS experience who reccomended 
                    the inspector tool.
                </p>

        <h2>Assignment 2: 4/25/2022</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
                <p>
                    I found the margin and positioning to be challenging for this assignment as things were getting shifted
                    or had weird spacing. I was able to solve this by use the inspector dev tool on my browser to investigate
                    the margin and padding of objects which helped me understand how different properties worked together. <br/>
                    Another problem I had was wanting to scale the add-twit button from the center without having to
                    calculate the new position myself. After some searching I was able to find the scale() property
                    which worked perfectly for my needs.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of positioning, flexboxes, and font-styling. I did not know much going into this
                    assignment but after I found a lot of cool CSS animations so I may try them later for the blog/homepage.

            <li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
                 completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
                <p>
                    The most helpful resources for me was the lectures as I learned some of the tricks I ended up using 
                    for this assignment such as the inline display for the list items in the navigation bar. I also
                    really liked the frog flexbox which was nice for practice. A student also hinted about using border
                    styling to get the underline effect for the active navigation page which led me to find border-bottom.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                <p>
                    One thing I had to Google was how to make my button grow from  the center as I felt there had to be
                    a better/quicker way to do it than having to calculate a new center position. This led me to find
                    "transform: scale()" which worked well. Another thing I searched for was removing the margin from my
                    nagivation and site title bar, I ended up realizing it was because of some default margins on the
                    body element using the stackoverflow link and the inspector tool.

        <h2>Assignment 3: 5/9/2022</h2>

        <ul>
            <li> What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
                <p>
                    I found differentiating between collections and actual objects somewhat challenging as I kept running
                    into errors trying to append to elements by ClassName instead of ID. However, after reading the console
                    errors from the browser dev tools and using console.log() it made more sense. Other times I was
                    not sure what was contained in my text variable for search_twits() as it kept evaluating to false.
                    I realized the issue after printing the text of the twit_array and it was in uppercase which made indexOf()
                    not work initially.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
                <p>
                    I learned the basics of javascript, how to create event listeners, how to manipulate the DOM, and 
                    add new content to the DOM. Some insights I had into this was that I first learned some Python in CS160-161
                    so I was familiar with how a lot of the string and array operations worked. Fortunately, a lot
                    of javascript syntax is similar to Python and C++ so it was not hard to pickup/use and the lectures were
                    awesome for learning.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Campuswire forum, the TAs) were most helpful in
                 completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
                <p>
                    The most helpful resources for me was the lectures, particularly the ones from 4/27, 5/2, and 5/4.
                    I also searched for specific problems / things I wanted to do with JS whenever I had no clue what
                    to do. I also reached out to my teammates (for the final project) and they had a lot of good tips
                    for the assignment like having to index [0] after getting elements by class name. I also took some 
                    of the example/demo code from class such as the string cleaning from the wordBoxes.js.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li> What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
                <p>
                    Two things I had to Google was how to do the search and how to clear an input field.
                    I learned I could use the string method indexOf() for searching since it gives the starting index 
                    for a substring that is in the current string. For clearing the input field, my issue was that
                    I was getting the value from the element and then trying to set it to an empty string "" but I was
                    not actually changing the value text element.

                    // Does not work  <br/>
                    text = element.value <br/>       
                    text = ""  <br/>
                    // Does work <br/>
                    element.value = "" <br/>
                    // This works too <br/>
                    text = element
                    text.value = ""
